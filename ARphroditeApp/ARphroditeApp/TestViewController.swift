Being a very simple program in most programming languages, it is often used to illustrate the basic syntax of a programming language for a working program.[1] It is often the very first program people write when they are new to a language. The CBATTRequest class represents Attribute Protocol (ATT) read and write requests from remote central devices (represented by CBCentral objects). Remote centrals use these ATT requests to read and write characteristic values on local peripherals (represented by CBPeripheralManager objects). Local peripherals, on the other hand, use the properties of CBATTRequest objects to respond to the read and write requests appropriately, using the respond(to:withResult:) method of the CBPeripheralManager class."
